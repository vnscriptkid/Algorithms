# Book of Data Structures and Algorithms - 1st Edition

# Chapter 1: Big-O Notation

## One way to measure how fast your code is?
- Using a timer
- What are problems?

## We need a better way?
- BigO: 
  - How the time grows as the input grows
  - Depend only on the size of the input but not other variables
  - General trend of time growing

## Patterns of BigO
- Instant: Time does not change as input grows
- Linear
- Quadratic

## Generalizations
